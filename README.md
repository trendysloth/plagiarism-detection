# Plagiarism Detector with AWS Sagemaker

This repository contains the Plagiarism Detector Project for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. It contains the jupyter notebooks and python files of the model and training.

### Project Details

* The Dataset was preprocessed with multiple features like Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Containment. Based on the correlation of the features, only a couple of features were selected for the final model to be trained upon.
* The Plagiarism Detector model is built using SciKit-Learn's RandomForestClassifier.
* It was trained and deployed in AWS Sagemaker.
